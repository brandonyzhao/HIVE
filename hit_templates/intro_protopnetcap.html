  <h2>ProtoPNet</h2>
  <p style="font-size:18px">
    The ProtoPNet model reasons with <strong>prototypes</strong> which are typical representations of
    a feature. For example, pink skinny long legs is a prototype for Flamingos.

    <br>
    Given a new bird photo, the model predicts the species based on prototypes it has learned from
    previously seen photos. For each prototype, the model finds a region in the photo that looks the
    most similar and rates its similarity. The model then predicts the bird species whose prototypes
    are the most similar to the photo. In the below example, the model predicts <b>Woodpecker</b> out of 200 bird species.
